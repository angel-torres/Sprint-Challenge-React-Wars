1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
    React is a javascript library that allows us to build dynamic user interfaces. The problem was that the DOM could not be very dynamic without 
    slowing down. Because react has it's own virtual DOM, it allows for the
    user interface to be very dynamic without slowing down the browser. 

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
    This has to do with building a user interface. To think in React means that 
    you have to learn to separate your user interface into different reusable components.

1.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
    A functional component is simply a javascript function that returns some JSX. A Class/Stateful component is a javascript class that extends React.Component. A Class component gives you more tools form React like the ability to use State to manage your data so that it interacts with each of the child components. 

1.  Describe state.
    State is an object that holds data. It allows you to create dynamic and interactive components that render the data in State dynamically. 

1.  Describe props.
    Props stands for properties. Props is how we pass down either data in State or even functions down to other components. Props allows components to communicate with one another.
